trading” refers to the purchase or sale of a security while in possession of “material” “non” information relating to the security “securities” includes stocks bonds notes debentures options warrants and other convertible securities as well as derivative instruments “purchase” and “sale” are defined broadly under the federal securities law “purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security but any contract to purchase or otherwise acquire a security “sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security these definitions extend to a broad range of transactions including conventional cashforstock transactions conversions the exercise of stock options and acquisitions and exercises of warrants or puts calls or other derivative securities it is generally understood that insider trading includes the following trading by insiders while in possession of material non information trading by persons other than insiders while in possession of material non information if the information either was given in breach of an insider’s fiduciary duty to keep it or was misappropriated and communicating or tipping material non information to others including recommending the purchase or sale of a security while in possession of such information what facts are material the materiality of a fact depends upon the circumstances a fact is considered “material” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy sell or hold a security or if the fact is likely to have a significant effect on the market price of the security material insider trading compliance approved kolloway mike the most current and effective version of this document is available and maintained on parsons center the company may revise rescind or add to any policies benefits or business practices from time to time in its sole and absolute discretion with or without

but are not limited to information about dividends corporate earnings or earnings forecasts possible mergers acquisitions tender offers or dispositions major new products or product developments important business developments such as major contract awards or cancellations trial results developments regarding strategic collaborators or the status of regulatory submissions management or control changes significant borrowing or financing developments including pending sales or offerings of debt or equity securities defaults on borrowings bankruptcies and significant litigation or regulatory actions moreover material information does not have to be related to a company’s business for example the contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that is expected to affect the market price of a security can be material a good general rule of thumb when in doubt do not trade what is non information is “non” if it is not available to the general in order for information to be considered it must be widely disseminated in a manner making it generally available to investors through such media as dow jones business wire reuters the wall street journal associated press or united press international a broadcast on widely available radio or television programs publication in a widely available newspaper magazine or news web site a regulation fdcompliant conference call or disclosure documents filed with the sec that are available on the sec’s web site the circulation of rumors even if accurate and reported in the media does not constitute effective dissemination in addition even after a announcement a reasonable period of time must lapse in order for the market to react to the information generally one should allow two full trading days following publication as a reasonable waiting period before such information is deemed to be who is an insider “insiders” include officers directors and employees of a company and anyone else who has material inside

additional prohibited transactions the company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk andor the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this policy engage in certain types of transactions therefore officers directors and employees shall comply with the following policies with respect to certain transactions in the company securities short sales short sales of the company’s securities evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value and therefore signal to the market that the seller has no confidence in the company or its shortterm prospects in addition short sales may reduce the seller’s incentive to improve the company’s performance for these reasons short sales of the company’s securities are prohibited by this policy in addition as noted below section c of the act absolutely prohibits section reporting persons from making short sales of the company’s equity securities ie sales of shares that the insider does not own at the time of sale or sales of shares against which the insider does not deliver the shares within days after the sale publicly traded options a transaction in options is in effect a bet on the shortterm movement of the company’s stock and therefore creates the appearance that an officer director or employee is trading based on inside information transactions in options also may focus an officer’s director’s or employee’s attention on shortterm performance at the expense of the company’s longterm objectives accordingly transactions in puts calls or other derivative securities involving the company’s equity securities on an exchange or in any other organized market are prohibited by this policy hedging transactions certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions such as zerocost collars and forward sale contracts allow an officer director or employee to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock these transactions allow the officer director or employee to continue to own the covered securities but without the full risks and rewards of ownership when that occurs the officer director or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the company’s other stockholders therefore such transactions involving the company’s equity securities are prohibited by this policy purchases of the company’s securities on margin pledging the company’s securities to secure margin or other loans purchasing on margin means borrowing from a brokerage firm bank or other entity in order to purchase the company’s securities other than in connection with a cashless exercise of stock options under the company’s equity plans margin purchases of the company’s securities are prohibited by this policy pledging the company’s securities as collateral to secure loans is also prohibited this prohibition means among other things that you cannot hold the company’s securities in a “margin account” which would allow you to borrow against your holdings to buy securities insider trading compliance approved kolloway mike the most current and

executive officers of the company directors and executive officers of the company may use the cashless exercise feature of their equity awards only if i the director or officer retains a broker independently of the company ii the company’s involvement is limited to confirming that it will deliver the stock promptly upon payment of the exercise price and iii the director or officer uses a “t+” cashless exercise arrangement in which the company agrees to deliver stock against the payment of the purchase price on the same day the sale of the stock underlying the equity award settles under a t+ cashless exercise a broker the issuer and the issuer’s transfer agent work together to make all transactions settle simultaneously this approach is to avoid any inference that the company has “extended credit” in the form of a personal loan to the director or executive officer questions about cashless exercises should be directed to the chief legal officer rule b trading plans section and rule rule b trading plans rule b will protect directors officers and employees from insider trading liability under rule b for transactions under a previously established contract plan or instruction to trade in the company’s stock a “trading plan” entered into in good faith and in accordance with the terms of rule b and all applicable state laws and will be exempt from the trading

b presents an opportunity for insiders to establish arrangements to sell or purchase company stock without the restrictions of trading windows and blackout periods even when there is undisclosed material information a trading plan may also help reduce negative publicity that may result when key executives sell the company’s stock rule b only provides an “affirmative defense” in the event there is an insider trading lawsuit it does not prevent someone from bringing a lawsuit a director officer or employee may enter into a trading plan only when he or she is not in possession of material non information and only during a trading window period outside of the trading blackout period although transactions effected under a trading plan will not require further preclearance at the
